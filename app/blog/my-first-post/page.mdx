# My First Post

Welcome to my new blog! This is the first post, created to show how easy it is to add new content.

## Getting Started

To create a new post, you just need to:

1.  Create a new folder in the `app/blog` directory.
2.  Add a `page.mdx` file to it.
3.  Write your content using Markdown and export your metadata.

It's that simple!
